# Cheb's Necromancy

Cheb's Necromancy adds Necromancy to Valheim via craftable wands and structures. Minions will follow you, guard your base, and perform menial tasks.

This mod was formerly called Friendly Skeleton Wand, but was renamed since it as grown into something so much more.

## Confused? Try the [wiki](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/wiki).

**Pre-release versions:** To get the latest improvements but with less testing, check the [GitHub's releases page](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/releases). Although less tested than the official releases, they are still tested pretty well.

## Requirements

- Valheim Mistlands
- BepInEx
- Jotunn

## Installation (manual)

- Drag the `ChebsNecromancy` folder from inside the archive to your BepInEx plugins folder in the Valheim directory.

## Features

- Craftable wands at the workbench called **Skeleton Wand** and **Draugr Wand**.
- These wands consume **Bone Fragments** to create minions.
- **Bone Fragments** now drop from all creatures when they die.
- With a wand equipped, the following is possible:
	+ **B** will make a warrior.
	+ **H** will make an archer.
	+ **F** will make all nearby minions **follow** you.
	+ **T** will make all nearby minions **wait**.
	+ **G** will teleport all following minions to your position (useful if stuck or to get them on boats)
	+ **R** to tell minions to **attack** a specific target (this is relatively inaccurate).
- A new **Necromancy Skill**.
- Minion quality increases with **Necromancy Skill Level**:
	+ 0 to 34: Level 1.
	+ 35 to 69: Level 2.
	+ 70+: Level 3.
- Minion health increases with necromancy level.
- Minions ignore collision with the player so you won't be trapped.
- You can make a special cape called the Spectral Shroud which draws spirits to it. If you're powerful enough, they will serve (necromancy level 25). Removing the cape stops them from spawning.
- Tweakable settings by editing the config file.
- A Spirit Pylon which can be constructed to serve as static base defence. It detects nearby enemies and if any are found, it spawns temporary Ghosts to defend the base with.
- Having additional items in your inventory can change your minions. As a safety measure to prevent you from accidently consuming stuff, hold Left Shift when creating a minion to permit these resources to be consumed (or set to None in the config if you want no checking whatsoever):
  - Boar scraps or Deer Hide -> leather armor
  - Bronze -> Bronze armor
  - Iron -> Iron armor
  - Black Metal -> Black Iron armor
  - Guck -> poison skeleton
  - Surtling core -> skeleton mage
- As of 1.5.0 you can create a Neckro Pylon which spawns undead Necks from Neck Tails with a container on its back. It wanders around gathering up items for you. It's like a walking vacuum cleaner.
1.5.0 also introduces a refueler pylon, that fills your smelters with ores and coal or wood, and a Bat Beacon which spawns bats to defend your base.

### Config

**Attention:** To edit the config as described, the [Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager/releases) is the most user friendly way. This is a separate mod. Please download and install it.

Press **F1** to open the mod's configuration panel.

You can also edit the configs manually. Almost everything can be tweaked to your liking.

## Known issues

- Skeletons can't follow you into/out of dungeons
	+ This might be fixable via mods like **Teleport Everything** ([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1806), [Thunderstore](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/OdinPlus/TeleportEverything/)).
- Telling minions to attack what you're looking at (by spawning a big stone there - dumb but will be replaced with something more appropriate later)
- Players with Radeon cards may experience weird issues. I don't know what's causing it, but turning off Draugr in the config may help because it seems related. If you encounter problems, try the following:
	+ `DraugrAllowed = false`
	+ `SpectralShroudSpawnWraith = false`

## Future Ideas

- Fully custom undead types.
