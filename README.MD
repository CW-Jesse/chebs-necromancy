# Friendly Skeleton Wand

This mod adds a craftable wand which can be used to create skeletons with. These skeletons are supposed to guard your base and hang around the general vicinity of wherever you create them.

## Requirements

- Valheim Mistlands
- BepInEx
- Jotunn

## Installation (manual)

- Drag the `FriendlySkeletonWand` folder from inside the archive to your Bepinex plugins folder in the Valheim directory.

## Features

- Craftable Wand at the workbench called **Friendly Skeleton Wand**.
- Pressing **B** while the Wand is equipped will create a friendly skeleton guard with **Bone Fragments** from your inventory.
- Nearby skeletons can be told to **Wait** by pressing **T**.
- Nearby skeletons can be told to **Follow** by pressing **F**.
- Skeleton quality increases with **Necromancy Skill Level**:
	+ 0 to 34: Level 1 skeletons.
	+ 35 to 69: Level 2 skeletons.
	+ 70+: Level 3 skeleotns.
- Skeletons created are either an archer or warrior. This is random.
- Tweakable settings by pressing **F1** to edit the config.
